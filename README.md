# Meditation
Meditation is a meditation app that provides a curated list of guided meditations that are playable within the app.  The user selects a current emotion and then populates a list of meditations that are relevant to that emotion.  If the user just wants to meditate on his/her own, a countdown timer is provided that allows the user to add time in 5 minute increments.

Meditation was created using MongoDB, AngularJS, Express.js, Node.js, and the libraries/plugins listed below.  The mp3 files are hosted on AWS s3 as many of them exceeded the size limit limit for storage in MongoDB.
